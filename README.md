qt_arduino
==========

A qt Widget to display information from arduino through serial connection

This example reads some values and computes speed (its a speedometer) but the basic idea for other usage is easy to understand

You need to connect arduino through serial and adjust the device path in the code (e.g /dev/...)

Requirements (as deb packages):
Python2, Python-qt4, Python-serial
